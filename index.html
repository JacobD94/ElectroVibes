        many examples of great or not so great electronic songs throughout the years and my

       <h2>My love for Electronic Music</h2>
      </header>
      <main>
       <p>I don't know what is actually was up with me. Back in the mid 2000s,
        when I was just a boy right before puberty hit me. I considered it not 
        real music even though it follows the standard 4/4 time signature. Being in band
        but an elitist and not a true music conessuer, I pushed it to the side. Even
        many metal and rock bands were considered mussic to me, even though I barely listened
        to it. It took me until 2012 when I was in high school and getting to know the opposite sex a big better I gravitated towards electronic music. It was both intellectually stimulating and it kept me calm whearas with metal at a younger age I was so numbed by it it nearly had no effect it seemed.

       <h2>Song of the Week</h2>
      </header>
      <main>
       <p>
        This song of the week which is given by the current site's design is: 
        <strong>Quezacotl by Deadmau5!</strong> This song from some EP released
        in 2024 is definitely atmospheric and calming. This song shows off 
        his ability to create such elements and blend <em>resonance</em> with minimalism. The 
        sound is definitely electroic with more <em>cinematic pieces</em> catering to those
        into <strong>progressive house</strong>, <strong>IDM</strong>, or <strong>ambient electronica.</strong>
       </p>
